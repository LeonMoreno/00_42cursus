## üí° About 42 School

	Created in 2013 by Xavier Niel, a successful French serial entrepreneur, 42 has now become an
	international reference for students and companies. Since then, the best computer programming
	school in the world* has trained thousands of professionals, to help eliminate the shortage
	of digital talents while addressing economic and technological mutations, thanks to the quality
	of its unanimously recognized education.
	
	Without registration or tuition fees, the selection of students is solely based on **talent and 
	motivation**. The "C Piscine" is a 26-day C programming bootcamp, and the last stage in the
	selection process for becoming a 42's student.

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.

## 42's Holy Graph (curriculum)

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ or _"common core"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout.

The **common core** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.

The table below presents the cursus curriculum in the chronological order in which it is being completed by me -- projects order may vary --.
